Executive Summary 

The purpose of the Grow Guru design project is to identify a real-world problem which users experience and provide a solution to alleviate end users. The problem that the team identified is regarding gardeners with busy lives who don’t have the time to care for their indoor plants. The team ultimately decided to create a self-watering indoor plant care system: The Grow Guru. 

Research is conducted to find the user’s top-ranked needs, which are low maintenance, effectiveness, versatility, and durability. These factors were considered when designing the product. The Grow Guru begins as a couple initial design sketches and later evolves into a physical low-level prototype. User feedback, tests, and analysis guides the concept to the updated design which is a more detailed sketch. This is then realized into a high-level physical prototype which becomes the final prototype design. This design consists of components such as the Arduino board, breadboard, wiring, framework to protect sensitive internal components and improve durability, a water pump and water tube for increased effectiveness and low maintenance, a neo-pixel light ring, a humidity sensor, an LCD screen, and a keypad. The Grow Guru contains key features to achieve a successful approach to quick and easy indoor gardening. These features include a self-watering system to water the plant, various watering interval cycle options via the keypad buttons to accommodate a diverse array of plant species, a grow light to aid the growth of the plant, an LCD screen to display the current cycle mode, humidity percentage, and temperature, a large water basin of which a filtration system allows excess water to seep back down into to be reused for the next cycle (decreasing the refill rate of the basin), and a sturdy, sleek frame to add to the aesthetic quality of the design. 

Various tests are involved in the verification and validation process of the product to ensure that the aforementioned qualities are each met. Some of which include a measurement of the water basin capacity, the overall weight of the design with all elements put together, functioning modes, display monitoring, and maintenance time measured in minutes. Market size and comparison of similar products are also considered to gauge the potential success of the design. 

As with any emerging product, the Grow Guru is projected to have an economic and social impact. Economically, it is expected to positively impact the market by fostering job creation and stimulating increased consumer spending. Similarly, the Grow Guru is expected to have a beneficial social impact by making the product accessible to a broader spectrum of users across various income levels. This inclusivity enhances the product's potential to serve diverse communities effectively. 

In conclusion, the Grow Guru significantly enhances indoor gardening by addressing the needs of busy gardeners with an innovative, low-maintenance design. From initial sketches to a sophisticated high-level prototype, the product's development process ensures it surpasses market expectations. Economically, it fosters job creation and boosts consumer spending, while socially, its affordability and functionality broaden access across broad income levels. The success of the Grow Guru stems from its practical combination of user-focused design and advanced functionality, making it a valuable tool for efficient indoor plant care.
